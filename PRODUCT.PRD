3. **Admins** - Platform administrators who manage users and oversee platform operations

### User Roles & Permissions
- **Admin**: Full system access, user management, system configuration
- **Job Announcer Customer**: Post and manage house jobs, view bids, select craftsmen
- **Craftsman/Master Customer**: Browse house jobs, place bids, manage profile

## Core Features

### Authentication & Security
- JWT-based authentication with 1-hour token expiration
- OAuth2 Google integration (completed) and Facebook integration (planned)
- Role-based access control with comprehensive permissions
- Secure password hashing with BCrypt encryption (strength 12)

### Craft men Management
- Craftsman profile management
- Skill and service category selection
- Bid management and tracking
- Job history and reviews

### House Job Announcer Management
- Job posting and management
- Bid review and selection
- Job status tracking (open, in-progress, completed, cancelled)
- Transaction history and analytics


### User Management (both Craftsmen and Announcers)
- User registration and profile management
- Role assignment and permissions (Announcer or Craftsman roles)
- Address and contact information management

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Requirements
- Java 24 with Spring Boot 4
- Spring Security for authentication and authorization
- JPA/Hibernate for data persistence
- Liquibase for database migration management
- H2 database for development, production-ready database for deployment
- Postgres DB for production
- REST-ful API design with OpenAPI specification and documentation
- unit and integration testing with JUnit and Mockito
- e2e testing with Selenium or Cypress

### Frontend Requirements
- Angular 21 with TypeScript
- Angular CLI for project scaffolding and management
- CoreUI components
- RxJS for reactive programming
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Component-based architecture
- HTTP client for API integration


### Database Requirements
- Relational database design with proper foreign key relationships
- Audit trail functionality (created/updated timestamps)
- Transaction integrity and ACID compliance
- Migration management through Liquibase

### Security Requirements
- Hashed password storage
- JWT token-based authentication
- OAuth2 social login integration
- Role-based access control
- API endpoint protection
- Input validation and sanitization

## Success Metrics
- Customer adoption rate across both three user types
- Transaction volume and success rate
- System uptime and performance
- User engagement and retention rates
- Job posting and bidding efficiency

## Timeline & Milestones

### Phase 1: Core Platform
- User authentication and role management
- Basic entity modeling and database setup
- JWT authentication implementation
- Core API endpoints

### Phase 2: Business Logic
- Complete service layer implementation
- DTO mappers and data validation
- Enhanced security with BCrypt
- LinkedIn OAuth2 completion

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Analytics dashboard
- Notification system
- Advanced reporting
- Mobile responsive optimizations

### Phase 4: Production Readiness
- Production database configuration
- Performance optimization
- Security audit and testing
- Deployment pipeline setup

## Risk Assessment
- **Technical Debt**: Current use of NoOpPasswordEncoder needs immediate attention
- **OAuth2 Integration**: Facebook integration requires completion for social login
- **Service Layer**: Business logic layer needs full implementation
- **Database**: Migration from H2 to production database required
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage needed for all layers

## Dependencies
- Spring Boot ecosystem
- Angular framework and tooling
- H2/Production database
- Google, Facebook OAuth2 API
- Maven build system
- npm/Node.js for frontend

## Constraints
- Java 21 minimum requirement. Try to use Java 24 if possible
- Angular 19 framework version minimum requirement. Try to use Angular 21 if possible
- Try to implement java Virtual Threads for better performance
- Spring Boot 4 compatibility
- Browser compatibility for modern web standards

## Future Enhancements
- Mobile application development (iOS and Android)
- Advanced AI-driven job matching algorithms
- Integration with third-party payment gateways
- Multi-language support for global reach
- Enhanced analytics with machine learning insights
- Gamification elements to boost user engagement
- Community forums and support channels
- Loyalty programs and referral incentives
